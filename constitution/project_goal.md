# Project Goal

## Mission
Build a production-grade web application with a Vue 3 + FastAPI architecture.

## Priorities
1. Correctness over speed
2. Maintainability over cleverness
3. Fast iteration over premature optimization

## Non-Negotiables
- Never sacrifice data safety or security for speed
- Always preserve backward compatibility unless explicitly authorized
- Ship small, tested increments

## Success Criteria
- Zero critical bugs in production
- Sub-200ms API response times (p95)
- 80%+ test coverage on critical paths
